Buy Now woocommerce is a helpful tool to simplify the checkout process. Buy Now woocommerce converts into a one-click process, customer decision to sale.

== Description ==
Buy Now Woocommerce is a plugin to allow the reduction of the steps inside the Woocommerce checkout process. You are able to simplify the checkout process by skipping the shopping cart page. The “Add to cart” button is added to each product to redirect customers to the checkout page. This can encourage buyers to shop more and quickly. You will increase your sales reducing cart abandonment.


= Highlights =
* Add Button on Checkout to go direct to the checkout page
* Auto add to cart and checkout
* Skip add to cart.
* Avoid reload checkout page.
* Simplify Woocommerce.

== Formerly Buy Now Woocommerce ==

This plugin was formerly known as \"Buy Now Woocommerce\". WordPress forced us on August 8, 2019, to change the name of the plugin due to the use of the \"WooCommerce\" word at the beginning of the name. We apologize for the problems that the downtime may have caused to you.

== Speed checkout process ==

Buy Now woocommerce aims to simplify the checkout process, leading to an immediate increase in sales. This plugin for WooCommerce allows you to redirect users to the checkout instead of the cart page, change the text and link of the added to cart alert and include the ajax add to cart button in the products pages.

== Quick purchase button ==

The premium version of Buy Now woocommerce allows to include a quick purchase button in the single products page that redirects your users directly to the checkout page, avoiding the need to force them to add the products to the cart.

== Improvements ==

1. Use less bandwidth
2. Reduce server load
3. Speed user experience
4. Increase your sales!

== Installation ==
* Add Button on Checkout to go direct to the checkout page
